# Introduction

In a chord diagram (or radial network), entities are arranged radially as segments with their relationships visualised by arcs that connect them. The size of the segments illustrates the numerical proportions, whilst the size of the arc illustrates the significance of the relationships<sup id="fnref-footnote"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-footnote">1</a></sup>.

Chord diagrams are useful when trying to convey relationships between different entities, and they can be beautiful and eye-catching.

# The Chord Package

I wanted to do a section on Chord Diagrams for my book, [Data Is Beautiful](https://store.shahinrostami.com/product/data-is-beautiful/).

With Python in mind, there are many libraries available for creating Chord diagrams, such as [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/v3/filled-chord-diagram/), [Bokeh](http://docs.bokeh.org/en/0.12.0/docs/gallery/chord_chart.html), and a few that are lesser-known. However, I wanted to use the implementation from [d3](https://observablehq.com/@d3/chord-diagram?collection=@d3/d3-chord) because it can be customised to be highly interactive and to look beautiful.

I couldn't find anything that ticked all the boxes, [so I made](https://pypi.org/project/chord/) a wrapper around d3-chord myself. It took some time to get it working, but I wanted to hide away everything behind a single constructor and method call. The tricky part was enabling multiple chord diagrams on the same page and then loading resources in a way that would support Jupyter Lab.

The primary support is for `Jupyter Lab` (not the older `Jupyter Notebook`).

# Installation

Available on https://pypi.org/project/chord/ through `pip`:

# Examples

You can see the actual interactive examples [on this page](https://shahinrostami.com/posts/statistics/data-is-beautiful/chord-diagrams/). The below examples are screenshots.

## The Dataset

The focus of this section will be the demonstration of the `chord` package. To keep it simple, we will use synthetic data that illustrates the co-occurrences between movie genres within the same movie.

```python
matrix = [
    [0, 5, 6, 4, 7, 4],
    [5, 0, 5, 4, 6, 5],
    [6, 5, 0, 4, 5, 5],
    [4, 4, 4, 0, 5, 5],
    [7, 6, 5, 5, 0, 4],
    [4, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0],
]

names = ["Action", "Adventure", "Comedy", "Drama", "Fantasy", "Thriller"]
```

## Default Settings

Let's see what the `Chord()` defaults produce when we invoke the `show()` method.

```python
Chord(matrix, names).show()
```

![Example Image](images/1.png)

You can also save it to an HTML file.

```python
Chord(matrix, names).to_html()
```

## Different Colours

The defaults are nice, but what if we want different colours? You can pass in almost anything from [d3-scale-chromatic](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic#categorical), or you could pass in a list of hexadecimal colour codes.

```python
Chord(matrix, names, colors="d3.schemeSet2").show()
```

![Example Image](images/2.png)

```python
Chord(matrix, names, colors=f"d3.schemeGnBu[{len(names)}]").show()
```

![Example Image](images/3.png)

```python
Chord(matrix, names, colors="d3.schemeSet3").show()
```

![Example Image](images/4.png)

```python
Chord(matrix, names, colors=f"d3.schemePuRd[{len(names)}]").show()
```

![Example Image](images/5.png)

```python
Chord(matrix, names, colors=f"d3.schemeYlGnBu[{len(names)}]").show()
```

![Example Image](images/6.png)

```python
hex_colours = ["#222222", "#333333", "#4c4c4c", "#666666", "#848484", "#9a9a9a"]

Chord(matrix, names, colors=hex_colours).show()
```

![Example Image](images/7.png)

## Label Styling

We can disable the wrapped labels, and even change the colour.

```python
Chord(matrix, names, wrap_labels=False, label_color="#4c40bf").show()
```

![Example Image](images/8.png)

## Opacity

We can also change the default opacity of the relationships.

```python
Chord(matrix, names, opacity=0.1).show()
```

![Example Image](images/9.png)

# Diagram Size

We can change the maximum diagram size by specifying a width.

```python
Chord(matrix, names, width=400).show()
```

We can change the padding between chord segments by specifying the padding.

```python
Chord(matrix, names, padding=0.3).show()
```

# Data and Templates

## Chord (free) package

The `chord` package downloads the Chord Diagram template from the `DataCrayon.com` (AWS hosted) server to generate the visualisation. The templates are maintained independently (bug fixes and optimisations). This means with a standard configuration, you will need to have an Internet connection to generate a visualisation.

Your parameter arguments (e.g. matrix, colors, etc) are not sent to the `DataCrayon.com` server.

## Chord PRO (full-featured) package

The `chord` package switches to `PRO` mode when a username and license are specified. This enables the use of all the `PRO` features.

This uses the Chord PRO API service hosted on the `DataCrayon.com` (AWS hosted) server to generate your visualisation. Your parameter arguments (e.g. matrix, colors, etc) are sent to the API, which then generates and returns your HTML content.
